## Usage
#### How to use `Auto Get Proxy`
- Step 1: Run get.cmd
> This script will download all the proxy files on different github sources.
- Step 2: Move all the proxy files into `proxies` folder
> Note: This is not a feature, it's very inconvenient. I will update the code in the next version.
- Step 3: Run merge.cmd
> This script will merge all the proxy files you put in into **ONE FILE**.
